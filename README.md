[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andpic/vector_addition_tutorials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andpic/vector_addition_tutorials)

The vector addition sample adds two vectors A and B to produce C, where C<sub>i</sub> = A<sub>i</sub> + B<sub>i</sub>. In this particular case the vectors A and B are filled with trigonometric data and summed. Both C and Fortran versions are presented where applicable.
